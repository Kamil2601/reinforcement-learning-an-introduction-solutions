    "First, let's look at the error of TD. $\\alpha = 0.05$ achieved the best result - error below $0.05$, error curve becomes flat around episode 75. Lower values of $\\alpha$ would probably reach the same error (or maybe a little smaller) but in more steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher values of $\\alpha$ converged faster during the first 25-50 steps, but later they started to get worse, the error went up. This effect (faster convergence at the beggining and divergence soon) is bigger for $\\alpha = 0.15$ than for $\\alpha = 0.1$ so it would have been even bigger for larger $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at MC. For the lowest $\\alpha = 0.01$, the error curve is the most smooth, but the learning is very slow, the error after 100 episodes is significantly higher than for TD (around 0.12). For higher values of $\\alpha$ the algorithm converges faster, after around 50 episodes we can see that the error often goes up in the next steps, more often and higher for larger $\\alpha$, this effect would be greater for larger $\\alpha$ values."
