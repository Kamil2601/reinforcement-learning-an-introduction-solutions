# Solutions to exercises from _Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction_ 2nd Edition, by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

This repository contains my personal solutions to exercises from Sutton & Barto's book.

Solutions to each chapter are in a separate folder. All solutions are in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files.

For each chapter, solutions to non-programming exercises are in the `chapter-n.ipynb` file, each programming exercise is in a seperate file `exercise_<chapter>-<exercise>.ipynb`.

Work in progress.
